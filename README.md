# Recipe Database searcher

This is an application to search a recipe that fits you. You tell the program wheter you like a couple recipes, and then it will recommend a list of recipes. This application was made in Module 6 of the course Intelligent Interaction Design for the Bachelor Technical Computer Science. This project was made in a group.

## Setting up virtual environment
Follow this tutorial, but use `$ pip install -r requirements` instead of `$ pip install Flask`. This will install all modules instead of only Flask.
